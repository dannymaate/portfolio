Consider renaming Press + Stories to something less confusing. 
This gives off impression that you're writing newspaper articles

What I did?
create new repo on github
git init 
git add ...
git commit ...
git push -u origin main

    hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
    hint: its remote counterpart.

git pull
git push -f origin main     # forces the overwriting of remote repo

future reference? 
create github repo first before making local project
git clone ...
then create project inside this

note to self:
For the articles use a different type of card for variation purposes
